# BeHatsuApp
## Why?
There's this app called "BeReal." that has gained much attention over the last year and a half (I'm writing this during May 2023). For those who don't know the app, it basically makes people take pictures at random times during the day forcing them to not be prepared to take them and thus have more genuiness in them.
I like the app's concept **A LOT**, but the social part of it is not suitable to my taste.
Thus, I decided to create a copy of the app from scratch in order to fulfill my dream of random pictures without having to share them with anyone.

##How?
