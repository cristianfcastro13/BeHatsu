## Why?
There's this app called "BeReal." that has gained much attention over the last year and a half (I'm writing this during May 2023).

For those who don't know the app, it basically makes people take pictures at random times during the day forcing them to not be prepared to take them and thus have more genuiness in them. The app then shares this picture with all the people that you have befriended.
I like the app's concept **A LOT**, but the social part of it is not suitable to my taste.
It is possible to not take part in the social side of the app (if you never befriend anyone), but since the app asks for your phone number during registration, whoever has your phone number and "BeReal." at the same time **WILL FIND YOU**.

Thus, I decided to create a copy of the app from scratch in order to fulfill my dream of random pictures without having to share them with anyone. (or having to befriend anyone)

## How?
Using Android Studio with some Kotlin probably mixed with Java. Also, XML.
I will be using a physical Samsung S10e to try the app as I develop it.

Since this is the first app that I develop, I will try to not include features that are too difficult to implement.
These 'difficult' features can include some level of compatibility with some android devices, dynamic scaling, and more to come.
Also, it will be easier because the pictures will be stored loally instead of on cloud.

## DevLog
For those interested, I keep a devlog that I update as I develop the app. It can be found in the same directory as this _'README.md'_ file
